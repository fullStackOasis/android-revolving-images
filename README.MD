# Android Project displays images one after another

This Android app uses an `ImageView` to display one of four different images.

The first image is displayed when the app starts. Then after a delay of 3 seconds, the next image is displayed, etc. After the fourth image is displayed, the first image is displayed again. This pattern continues until the app is closed.
